# Arithmetic Operators

# a = 7
# b = 2

# print('sum: ',a + b)

# print('multiplication: ',a * b)
# print('division: ',a / b)
# print('floor division: ',a // b)
# print('modulo: ',a % b)
# print('Power: ',a ** b)

# Assignment Operators

# a = 10
# b = 5
# a += b
# print(a)

# Comparison Operators

# a = 5
# b = 2

# print('a == b =', a == b)
# print('a != b =', a != b)
# print('a > b =', a > b)
# print('a < b =', a < b)
# print('a >= b =', a >= b)
# print('a <= b =', a <= b)

# Logical Operators
# a = 5
# b = 6
# print((a > 2) and (b >= 6))

# Identity Operators

# x1 = 5
# y1 = 5
# x2 = 'Hello'
# y2 = 'Hello'
# x3 = [1,2,3]
# y3 = [1,2,3]

# print(x1 is not y1)
# print(x2 is y2)
# print(x3 is y3)

# Membership Operators

x = 'Hello world'
